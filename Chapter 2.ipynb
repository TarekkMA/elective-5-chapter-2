    "### Q: Why is multithreading needed? How can multiple threads run simultaneously in a single-processor system?\n",
    "Multithreading can make your program more responsive and interactive, and enhance the performance. Multithreading is needed in many situations, such as animation and client/server computing. Because most of the time the CPU is idle--for example, the CPU is doing nothing while the user enters data--it is practical for multiple threads to share the CPU time in single processor systems."
